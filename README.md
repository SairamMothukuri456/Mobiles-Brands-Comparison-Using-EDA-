# 📱 Mobile Dataset – EDA & Web Scraping Project

## 📖 Overview

This project combines *web scraping* and *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to understand mobile phone pricing trends, brand distribution, and how features like RAM, battery, and screen size affect prices.
The dataset was created by scraping Flipkart mobile listings and analyzed using **EDA PROJECT (1).ipynb** with the **Mobile_Dataset.csv** file.
